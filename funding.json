It reduces context switching in polyrepo workflows by giving developers a single, safe overview of repository state.\n\ngit-scope is intentionally read-only, local-first, and privacy-focused. It does not modify repositories, run background services, or collect telemetry. The project prioritizes reliability, predictability, and long-term maintainability over rapid feature expansion.\n\nFeatures include fuzzy search, dirty filtering, workspace switching, contribution graphs, disk usage visualization, and editor integration.\n\nActively maintained with community contributions and stability-focused releases.",
